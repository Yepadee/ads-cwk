Amit at Olive Nation sent me an answer today. Although bark is depicted on the label, this oil is not from true cinnamon bark but from the leaf of the cassia plant.  It is not true \\""Ceylon cinnamon\\"".<br /><br />Cinnamon consumers who use it daily (such as diabetics who want to lower blood sugars with cinnamon) would do well to use caution with cassia products.  According to Web MD cassia contains significant amounts of a chemical called coumarin that can cause or worsen liver disease or impact kidneys in some people.<br /><br />Update January 12, 2015:  I shopped for true cinnamon bard from Ceylon cinnamon on line and queried the merchant, DruEra, to ensure it is genuine.  The response I received:  \\""We market Ceylon Cinnamon Bark oil which is food grade and 100% Cinnamomum Zeylanicum\\"".<br /><br />DruEra was quick to ship.  I received my package today.  The order came in a nice wood box, and the safety encasing of plastic over the bottle assured me it was never opened.  The Cinnamomum Zeylanicum bark oil I received is complex and exceedingly rich in terms of fragrance and flavors.  When I tried a drop it did not burn my tongue and was soothing to my stomach.  A 3 oz bottle cost me $40 plus $9 shipping/handling and arrived via Fed Ex with signature required. The expiration date on the bottle is 12/2016.

It can be found naturally in many plants, and commercial production focuses on extracting it from the fiber from corn cobs or wood pulp.  It can even be extracted from the fiber leftover when sugar is made from cane.<br /><br />There are several health benefits to xylitol compared to sugar.  It has significantly fewer calories than sugar and a significantly lower glycemic index, and the body does not use insulin to metabolize it, so it may benefit diabetics and those who are overweight.  It also inhibits rather than feeds the acid-producing bacteria that cause tooth decay, so it is often added to toothpaste, oral washes, and chewing gum.  The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry even supports recommending products with xylitol for use by children at moderate to high risk of dental caries.<br /><br />I compared plain Morning Pep Xylitol to ordinary granulated refined sugar.  The xylitol crystals are larger but are pure white, just like the sugar crystals.  It has a neutral odor rather than a sweet smell like sugar.  It seems to dissolve in liquids at about the same rate as sugar, perhaps a bit slower.<br /><br />The sweetness is very similar to that of sugar and it has absolutely no unpleasant aftertaste, but it is not quite as immediately intense on the tongue as sugar is and the flavor is not quite as complex.  However, when it is added to a beverage with flavor like coffee or tea, I can detect absolutely no difference.  Xylitol sweetens perfectly.<br /><br />When used in baking, more liquids may need to be used and it doesn't brown and caramelize like sugar does, but simply melts.  There are plenty of recipes available on the internet and it is fun to experiment.  Xylitol is generally used 1:1 instead of sugar.<br /><br />The Morning Pep Xylitol is of high quality, very pure and even in consistency and color.  It is made in the U.S.A. and comes packaged in heavy, resealable, moisture-proof pouches, which is very convenient.  I definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Morning Pep provided xylitol for evaluation and review.pure and even in consistency and color.

At 4-5 dollars a pop, it adds up quick. Taro was one of my favorites, and is great mixed with just milk and no tea.<br /><br />This product is identical to the taro drinks I've enjoyed. It's purple (lavender?), super sweet, and smells delicious. In fact at 4 lbs, I recommend that you purchase this with a friend, unless you are running a business. I found that even with my thorough enjoyment of taro, it was too difficult to consume all of the taro powder I had without getting sick of it.<br /><br />But this stuff is the real deal. I've had bad taro from restaurants, and I can honestly say that this is the best taro powder I've had. I recommend getting some coconut powder/mix to go with it- Taro and Coconut are some of my favorite flavors to mix when I go to a bubble tea shop. It looks like it costs a lot, but if you consider how much you'll save not buying from the store - it's a no brainer.	2014-11-29

It can take up to an hour to grind an ounce of matcha, and that labor-intensiveness plus the relative freshness of the matcha tends to dictate the price, which usually ranges from reasonable-but-expensive to very-very-expensive.<br /><br />This offering from One Organic is cheap culinary grade matcha. As a comparison, you can get &#34;economy&#34;/daily-use drinking matcha direct from Japan for about $12-15 an ounce.  This matcha is @$20 for nearly 9 oz.  Unfortunately, price is truly an indicator of quality matcha, and this tea tastes as cheap as it costs.<br /><br />Right out of the package, you can see a clear difference between this matcha and higher grades.  Fresh, good matcha should be neon green in color - the One Organic matcha is a dingy &#34;Army&#34; green by comparison (see the picture I posted for a comparison between One Organic and a &#34;better than average&#34; quality matcha that I had on hand which runs about $14 per oz, and is considered good quality but not highest quality).<br /><br />I nearly always prepare my matcha as usucha, or &#34;thin type&#34; matcha (this refers to the consistency, not the flavor), and my usual amount is about 2 grams of matcha to roughly 4 oz of water, although you can change these proportions slightly to suit your taste. I tried several attempts of two different preparations using the One Organic matcha: matcha + water, and matcha + water mixed into @6 oz of unsweetened almond milk.  I found both types of preparations to be undrinkable - very bitter and flat, with none of the smoothness and creamy mouthfeel (a quality called &#34;umami&#34;, that is somewhat hard to describe, but is a kind of savory, &#34;meaty&#34; flavor) that a good matcha should have.  Some of the better quality matchas even taste sweet.  While some matcha can be slightly bitter, the bitterness is very mild and should not be the overwhelming aspect.<br /><br />I tried different strengths of both types of preparation, and couldn't get anything other than an overwhelmingly bitter taste from the One Organic matcha.<br /><br />I'm giving this two stars since if you only use it as a healthful additive to smoothies and baked goods and can disguise the taste, then perhaps this is good value for your money. But if you are interested in trying matcha straight (matcha + water), this would be a terrible introduction to it, and I cannot recommend it.<br /><br />If you want to try matcha as its own drink, then don't start with this matcha. You might walk away thinking this is how matcha should taste and then never try it again.  Instead look for &#34;ceremonial-grade&#34; matcha rather than &#34;culinary-grade&#34; matcha. Even the lowest-price ceremonial grade matcha will have a flavor profile that is more accurate to how good matcha tastes.  Personally, my &#34;daily-use&#34; matcha is usually @ $12 per oz; when I want to treat myself, I'll sample a higher grade matcha that falls between $14-$20 per oz.  If you really want to splurge for the best of the best, go for the $40-$50 per oz matchas.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that the reason why matcha tastes how it does is because of the potency of the high amount of amino acids it contains.  A matcha that doesn't taste like &#34;good&#34; matcha is inferior not just in flavor but in the potency of its healthful elements.<br />[Sample provided for review]tter, the bitterness is very mild and should not be the overwhelming aspect.<br /><br />I tried different strengths of both types of preparation, and couldn't get anything other than an overwhelmingly bitter taste from the One Organic matcha.<br /><br />I'm giving this two stars since if you only use it as a healthful additive to smoothies and baked goods and can disguise the taste, then perhaps this is good value for your money.

I also use sardines in other dishes and since no one else in my household is OK with bones, I have recently tried all of the skinless/boneless brands available on Amazon.  These ones are my favorite brand in water- they really pack in the sardines unlike other brands that may be 50/50 water/fish.  You get three fat, whole sardines compared to others that are three or four sad broken pieces swimming in oil/broth. Since I usually use some kind of sauce with these, the dryness isn't a factor for me, but it may be for some.  They are not overly salty and have a fresh, clean taste.

I thought it was a really GREAT thing that this was helping people and that my purchase was not only going to benefit me, but also someone that really needed it.  I waited until I could justify the purchase and bought it this week.  I followed the fluffing up directions, let it sit overnight and made a chili the next day, following every direction explicitly regarding boil times as if was my first time using it and I wanted it to work.<br /><br />My chili contained beans, vegetables, and canned beef.  After it boiled for the appropriate time I took the temp to make sure it wasn't over the 350 and wouldn't hurt the bag.  I placed it in the bag nice and tight and forgot about until a couple of hours later I heard the food bubbling. I thought to myself , GREAT ! It's really keeping it warm and letting it cook.  At dinner time 7 hours later I tell my husband I made chili and I go to get it out, and you can tell it is definitely NOT hot, at all.  I took the temp and it was at 122.  I don't know how long it was at that temperature and had to throw away the food.<br /><br />Here are my issues -  The Wonderbag will keep my food warm, and it will keep it cool, but from my experience the only safe way to use the bag is in that fashion for up to 2 hours.  The danger zone is below 145 or so for bacteria to grow, and it can grow quickly.  Someone else's 1 star review goes over that in more depth.  It's not safe and it shouldn't be marketed as a slow cooker, it should be marketed as a way to keep hot foods hot for longer, or cold foods cold.  It's good for that, and for that purpose I'd give it more stars.<br /><br />My last issue is an Amazon glitch stating that this cannot be returned.  If you contact them directly they are able to assist you and send you a return shipping label.  Three weeks after I received a refund they still have not fixed the \\""no returns\\"" glitch which is unacceptable.

The product is passable as an instant brown rice.  Not much flavor, but it's passable if you need a quick side-dish or some filler ingredients for things likes soups.  But nothing to write home about.    However, I would like to address the huge issue- this is DANGEROUS to cook in the microwave!  The box (and website) proclaims that the cooking time in a microwave is seven minutes for 2 servings.  The instructions tell you to put the water and rice into a microwave-safe bowl and set the timer.    I did this once a few months ago, and at the five-minute mark I took the rice out and noticed that the water had completely evaporated and the rice was bizarre and overly crispy in terms of texture, and had even started to burn around the edges.  I decided to mark it up to me maybe not putting in enough water, and simply made some on the stove.    I tried it for a second time yesterday while visiting a friend, and this time it ended up almost setting his microwave on fire!  Three minutes in, I peeked in and noticed that the water seemed to be completely gone.  Weary but wanting to follow the instructions, I decided to let it cook another minute before checking it again.  When I returned about 60 seconds later, I found the microwave FULL of thick, billowing smoke.  Panicked, I opened the door and looked to see what was happening.  The rice had began to turn a dark, dark, burnt brown color (even become smoldering and black in spots) and was starting to burn up!  I can only imagine what would have happened if I let it go the full seven minutes!    Neither microwave is dysfunctional, and both are fairly weak microwaves.  (Usually we need to put things in a little longer, if anything.)  I have never, ever had this happen before with a product.  (I've cooked other rices in microwaves before when in a bind, although I prefer stove-top, and this never happens.)  And the fact it happened with two different microwaves (including one nice, big and expensive one and a smaller generic one) is just insane.    This is ludicrous.

In that book he's telling the dirty secrets of the pharmaceutical companies.  Shane says, \\""My keen interest in nutrient logic helped me become an award-winning scientist and a medicinal chemist for one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. My studies and experience confirmed what I always knew: proper nutrient intake is the biggest determinant of overall health, longevity, and athletic performance. Nutrient logic has been saving lives throughout history.\\""  Nutrient logic states that humans can thrive with proper nutrients and will not thrive without these key nutrients.  Shane quit his career as a drug designer because he was disgusted with Big Pharma's willingness to ignore nutrient logic as a viable and inexpensive alternative to drugs.    Shane says, \\""A growing body of research revealed that soy protein contains plant estrogens such as genistein and daidzein, causing feminizing effects in the male body.

His website has an article entitled, \\""Soy is Not a Health Food: 6 Things to Know About Soy's Big Downside.\\""  He states, \\""While soy may not kill you outright, soy's ability to undermine health is significant, and as a Wellness Practitioner I always advise my patients to remove it from their diets. Why? Because soy plays a role in the development of a number of debilitating conditions, which can morph into far larger problems down the line. For starters, soy disrupts thyroid and endocrine function. It interferes with leptin sensitivity, which can set you up for metabolic syndrome. Soy screws with your sex hormones by throwing off the estrogen and testosterone balance. It also helps block your body's ability to access key minerals like iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium. If that weren't enough, soy is a potentially lethal allergen to a segment of the population and an inflammation-triggering irritant to millions of people who may not even be aware that they're sensitive to it.\\""  He also states that \\""it's estimated that well over 95% of all soy is genetically modified. It's also known to be one of the most pesticide drenched crops on the market.\\""    Dr. Lipman also said, \\""Factory-farmed soy crops are amazingly destructive to just about everything they come in contact with, stripping the soil of nutrients, sickening the livestock who are fed it, inflaming the bodies of the people who eat it, and polluting the bodies of those who till the land.

A few of the people I work with had been saying how wonderful a juice cleanse was and they do them periodically.  So I purchased my boxes at a neighborhood health food start and started on January 6th after quitting caffeine and alcohol 2 days prior.  I'm basically a one cup of coffee/one glass of wine type person anyways so I didn't think I would have too much of a problem.<br /><br />Started the cleanse.  Juices tasted okay, but I make a green drink with kale, spinach etc anyways, so I'm used to the taste.  Was hungry but just kept busy. I was cold all day as a couple of other reviewers wrote and felt weaker, which I wasn't expecting until the 2nd day.  Around 4 pm the headache and diarrhea started, followed by the vomiting. Both of which did not end until around 9:30 pm.  Maybe I have so many toxins in my body that this detox is particularly hard, but I can't finish the cleanse. I did not eat anything, because I want at least one fully day of cleansing and was having trouble even keeping sips of water down.  I have 3 bottles of juice still left from the one day that I wasn't able to drink.<br /><br />Be warned. This cleanse, to my body, feels like giving myself a stomach bug. You may want to start with just one day and see how you feel. If your body can tolerate a cleanse such as this, the Suja brand is probably fine.  I did end up losing 5 lb, but most of that will come back.  I also lost most of my afternoon and evening yesterday due to extreme nausea. I don't think everyone can tolerate a cleanse like this.

It also causes a cancer cell to become more mobile, and that enhances metastasis, or spread.

The manufacturer is negligent and even deceptive in marketing this manufactured product as if it were all natural.<br /><br />Xanthan gum is a largely indigestible polysaccharide that is produced by bacteria called Xanthomonas Camestris.  Manufacturers place the bacteria in a growth medium that contains sugars and other nutrients, and the resulting product of bacterial fermentation is purified, dried, powdered, and sold as xanthan gum. (Makes you wonder who first thought to put it in food, doesn't it?)<br /><br />In other words, xanthan gum is an industrial processed product--  It is a polysaccharide produced by a biotechnological fermentation process--a chemical. There is nothing natural about xanthan gum.<br /><br />Certainly never mix or serve to small children until the dangers are fully explained by the FDA's ongoing investigations. Currently, there are on-going lawsuits as a result of Xanthan Gum being added to baby formula to thicken it, the babies intestines developed holes and collapsed, resulting in deaths.<br /><br />FDA has issued new cautions and studies as to this food additive's safety. It certainly should not be sold in bulk giving the appearance that it is a flour of some type very misleading and possibly deadly.  We'll likely all hear more soon on this issue - just be cautious and know what and how much you are putting into your food and body - or your family's.<br /><br />One lesser-known use of xanthan gum is in the oil industry. As a thickener, it can be added to drilling fluid or drilling mud to improve its function. Drilling fluid serves several purposes, including cooling the drill bit, providing hydrostatic pressure, and helping to lift solids out of the borehole and keeping those solids in suspension when drilling stops.<br /><br />Gluten-free is not the same food just without Gluten, something else is added in it's place.

We stopped solids for 2 weeks, wondering if it was too early (it wasn't, baby was 6.5 months old - pediatrician approved for foods, ER too said this is not gag reflex but stomach issue due to food/quality).  We started again with the pea jar, and my baby only had 2 spoons and locked its mouth shut.  I wondered, can it taste so bland?  No.  It tasted like flour and water, super nasty, super fake taste, nothing even remotely like peas.  I felt so bad that I fed this poor quality to my baby, and vowed that was the end with Earth's Best, and from then only make my own baby food.<br /><br />Once in a while, I do buy ready made baby food, for fruits/veggies which are not in season.

You probably won't have the same experience but I advise caution.  It left me horribly sick and feeling as if I would die.  But again, that's my personal experience which is why I've edited this review to reflect that.  I'm keeping the one star as it reflects my experience.<br /><br />Finally feel somewhat normal again after a week, still not 100% yet.  My review is very negative but I had a very strong reaction to this stuff.  If you are sensitive to some vegetables, fruits, and eggs like I am you definitely want to take caution when trying this product.  A shame, I could see myself getting a lot of mileage out of these as I seem to be the only negative reviewer who didn't have an issue with the smell and texture.",2013-06-29,439,-0.9742

I was looking for a good tasting oolong tea to add to my supply of green and black teas.  Like the good tasting, clear amber oolong tea I enjoy in Chinese restaurants.  Upon opening the box and taking out a bag to make a cup, some brown 'powdery debris dust' shook out.  The cup of tea was more brown and not as amber and clear as the restaurant oolong tea I wanted, although the taste was similar; not unpleasant.  A bit as if mixing a good oolong with a bit of lipton tea only not as clear as either.  An hour or two later, however, I was doubled over with a stomach ache and the tea's laxative effect was more severe than drinking a bottle of magnesium citrate which the doctor may recommend before a test or when backed up for a week and needing to pass a kidney stone.  Only with a stomach ache to boot.  It continued and I was sick for two days and could not leave home. I have never had a problem when traveling but assume much the same as when some people pick up a bug which has a similar effect. I have just read reviews that say some people use this for weight loss.  I think there must be better, more healthy ways if that is what you want.

The main problem is the seal that is created when screwing on the cap with the bottle itself- it just doesn't always screw on well and makes you question whether you have a tight seal or not.  Secondly, the grid part which serves to break up the powders doesn't function as well and quickly as the spring balls do - and is much harder to clean in that sense since you have to pop the grid in and out to properly clean it.  Plus there's more surface area to clean in general.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Large size - holds ~ 28 ounces of water<br />- Interior is easier to clean as it has a wider mouthed opening, thus allowing for larger hands to adequately clean the bottom<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Screw on top doesn't always screw into place well.  My friend had the same issue<br />- spring ball > grid in terms of efficiently breaking up the powder.<br />- Cap falls off all the time - is held in place by only two small pegs<br />- Ergo - the bottle shape itself doesn't fit very well in the hands, especially for people with smaller hands.<br /><br />I'd never buy this bottle again.

It's certainly a lot better than ramen noodle soup.  It's not as good as the kind you would get in the restaurant, but it's still very tasty and filling.  I even really like the texture of the noodles.<br /><br />2)  It's super easy.  Despite the directions being in poor English, they are still very easy to understand.  Just dump the noodles in a bowl (tupperware is good, because it has a lid).  Open the 3 packets that come with it (flavoring oil, soup base, and vegetables), and dump them in the bowl.  Microwave 400 ml (approximately 1 3/4 cup) of water in a separate container until it's boiling (about 3 minutes and 20 seconds).  Dump the water over the noodles, cover, and let sit for 3 minutes.  Easy.<br /><br />3)  It's cheap.  I got 24 bags for 22.75.  Less than a dollar a package.

There are plenty of inexpensive, microwave-for-a-minute food products that have *not* made me feel as though I am about to become violently ill. This is not one of them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the package, there were alarm bells going off in my head. &#34;What is this brown, murky swamp doing in place of my chicken carbonara?&#34; I should have tossed it right then and there, but I am stupid and therefore did not. I swirled the swampy bits around to see if maybe it would begin to resemble something food-like. Eventually, noodles and chunks of chicken made themselves apparent, along with wispy peppers and barely detectable bacon pieces. I hesitated. I allowed myself another moment of doubt, another moment during which I could have done the sensible thing and removed this unholy nightmare from my kitchen. But no. I put it in my mouth instead. It was...not good, but I kept at it with a weird sense of determination. It continued being not good, the only function of which it is capable. At some point, I think I developed Stockholm Syndrome; by the time I gave up--I think I'd eaten maybe two-fifths?--I was convinced it wasn't THAT bad.<br /><br />It's been about three hours since I deemed this...stuff...fit to put in my body, and let me tell you: it is THAT bad. It really, really is. Things are happening to my stomach which should not happen to human stomachs. I have been on the verge of vomiting for at least 45 minutes. I actually felt motivated to write an Amazon review of a microwavable meal I bought for like $2.30 at the grocery store, so clearly *something* terrible has happened.

That's important to note.  And, I stored them properly, per the instructions on the bag.  But after awhile (perhaps because they were around for a long time), my cats started to get sick after eating them.  Here's my story - and then you can decide whether you think you want to feed your cats these flakes or not:<br /><br />Although these flakes are for human consumption, the ingredient (100% Bonito Tuna Flakes) is identical to that in other tuna flakes I've purchased for my cats.  Given the huge cost savings buying these, I thought they were a great deal, and my two cats didn't seem to notice a difference.  They ate the flakes as their nightly treat for a month, then another, and into another ....  Eventually, my cats started to get sick nearly every night or near morning. At first, I thought one or both were going through a \\""hairball\\"" period and tried their hairball treats.  Nope, that didn't do the trick.  Then I considered their food and pulled back a new kibble I had added to their regular diet given they both had dental care done a few weeks back.  No change.  So, on to the vet we went to make sure the problem wasn't a side effect of their dental procedures (e.g., infection, some other problem).  Nope - my cats were otherwise healthy.<br /><br />But the problem persisted and was becoming a real issue: I was tired of seeing them miserable (in the times I saw them during the time they were sick) and I was tired of buying (and using!) SpotShot to clean carpet stains.  Finally, in desperation, I did the only other thing I could think of - I stopped giving them their tuna flakes.  They weren't happy.  They cried at night.  I live in a rural area and was patiently awaiting the next order of tuna flakes for cats (paid for 1-day shipping, but didn't order until late on a Saturday afternoon - alas!)  Here's the amazing thing: the nightly vomiting stopped. When the new flakes arrived (from a company I used before, who also sells flakes in volume, although about 1/3 the volume of this bag), I carefully started to give them their nightly treat again.  No problem at all.  They've been fine since.<br /><br />I'm not a scientist.  I can't conclusively state the flakes made my cats sick or at what point the flakes became too old to be safe for my cats.  These flakes are labelled as for human consumption, but the ingredient is the same as what is in cat tuna flakes (although I thought these flakes might be a touch \\""smokier\\"" in scent).  But what happened is enough for me.  I won't be buying these anymore.  Not worth it.  My kitties and I are back to a happy nightly feeding schedule with their old flakes and no problems!",2012-10-27,256,-0.9409

This tactic gets quite expensive.<br /><br />The weakest point of a Keurig are it's boldest blends cannot touch an actual strength of a Starbucks French Roast which my wife packs into a cartridge in the Keurig daily as she is used to French Press and Keurigs weakest point are it's weak coffee blends in about 90% of the cartridges I've tried.

Company advertises Made in USA - lie Made in China!,"I received the product and carefully read the instructions that were included and examined the product and inscriptions on it.  I cleaned it off, added my coffee and inserted it into my Keurig brewer. I lowered down the latch and noticed that the fit was not exact even though I had inserted the Eko cup.  I brewed my coffee and then proceeded to clean out the Eko cup.  That's when I noticed that even though the Eko cup was inserted, it had wiggle room to pivot in the K-cup holder and by doing so, the needle on the bottom of my K-cup machine that punches the drain hole into a pre-filled K-cup bottom had pierced through the bottom of the Eko cup ruining it.  Now the manufacturer did make a cut out space for the needle to fit into, but the tolerances are not good enough and no warnings exist on the Eko cup or written instructions to caution against this situation. There are no alignment arrows imprinted on the cup and no directions to alert the user to make certain the fit is correct even if it seems that it is correct.  So, I brewed a $10 cup of coffee and Amazon has a no return policy on this product.  My advice:  stick with the K-cup or Solocup until this design defect is corrected.  Also of note, the manufacturer's website proudly displays a Made in USA graphic while the actual product is made in China.

The reason I am reviewing this particular item is because you CANNOT return it. I had never order food (if this really qualifies) from Amazon, and simply thought if I don't like I'll just send it back. Wrong!    My first impression was, what do I do with the liquid? The fettuccini comes in some type of brine or liquid preservative. After reading the package it says to pour the liquid out, rinse for 10-15 seconds, boil for 1 minute and then dry with a paper towel, after that simply add to your favorite dish. It is supposed to soak up the flavors in your dish.    Ok let's give it a shot. I cut a corner of the package and started pouring out the liquid. uhh, what is that awful smell...? The slimy liquid smells like fish. I had to open the faucet and wash the liquid as it hit the sink. I had to stop half way and wash my hands, the smell was very pungent.    I thought maybe this is an expire batch. So I looked for the expiration date and it read Nov 15, 2011. Ok, it is not rotten it is just the way it is. I got the strainer and just empty the rest of the packet in, liquid and all. I let the tap water hit it for about 30 second and took a swift, it still smell... so I man up and started washing the fettuccini by hand. It took about 2 minutes of running water and hand tossing to get all that liquid washed up.    I had a pot of boiling water going and put the fettuccini to cook for about a minute and a half, took it out and rinsed it in cold water (not in the instructions). Check for smell and it was gone. The true test was on the taste; well... it taste like nothing really, no flavor whatsoever. As far as texture it resembles pasta in looks; however, if I had to describe it I would say is like a jellyfish tentacle (not that I have ever eating one, but how I imagine it to be), somewhat chewy and a little slimy.     I did not have a prepared dish to add it to, so I added some parmesan cheese and ketchup and ate it like past. The verdict... it was a mediocre pasta imitation. Perhaps if I did not cook it myself but it was served to me, meaning I did not have to put up with the awful fish smell, I would have enjoyed it more. I just could not stop thinking, what am I eating?    The only reason I give it a 3 star is because aside from the fish smell at the beginning and that, what on earth is this? bouncing in my head the entire time, I think it could become an acquired taste. Also, if added to a soup or some heavy sauce dish, I can see a potential for this as filler.    At the end if you decide to try it, know that you may not be able to pass the fish smell and end up throwing the whole thing in the trash. I almost did. Also, remember that you may not return this product.    Bon Appétit",2011-09-20,309,-0.5995

I was shocked at the horrible quality of the peanuts,  wether it be in the can, one gallon, or in the new tear bags that can be heated in the microwave oven.  The different kinds of packaging was fine, how ever the quality of the peanuts was just awful at best.  So many were just empty shells (approximately 30%) many had black like goo where the peanuts should be in the shells.  They appear to go from the ground directly into the boiling pot.  The taste is pure dirt water with grit in your mouth!  The shells are actually very ugly to look at before you start to open them.  They are very dirty, some look like normal peanuts, some were pure black in color, some have a good half with the other half nothing but soft mush.  Some looked like they had molded in the shell and then afterwards they were boiled and packaged ready to eat!  The peanuts I purchased had a really bad consistency in peanut quality. There is a lot of shell material in the cans, it makes one think that the company never changes out the water the use to boil in, hence the large amount of dirty shell particulate in the product.  Some of the shells were so rotten, I did not actually like touching the product with my fingers!  That is bad! Even trying to pick them apart was terminated because they were just too mushy and the inside merged with the shell to form a mass that definitely was not going into my mouth.  I threw them in the garbage disposal until I realized that I needed to save the can to take back to the store so Walmart management could see what it is they are selling to the public.

Vita Coco has changed their formula to include vitamin C, possibly to prevent the problem I had: a product that smelled and tasted like rotting fish. About half of the products contained clear liquid, and about half when you opened them contained a urine-colored product, with the white cardboard around the mouthpiece having fringed into a brownish color. Vita Coco assured me this was a normal color variation. I drank quite a few of them, and the tasted varied greatly. Some were almost as sweet as glucose syrup and I had to cut them with water. Some tasted what I would call normal. And then I came across one of the brown mouthpieced ones with urine-colored product which smelled and tasted like rotten fish. I called Vita Coco again and again was told that I should be happy that there is a color and taste variation because it indicates a natural product. I was then interrupted and asked if I had a point I was trying to make. I told the customer service agent at Vita Coco I was telling her the product tasted like rotting fish. And she responded by telling me that she liked fish. She asked me if I call a lot of companies to complain about products. I will give myself a lot of credit and say that I remained calm in spite of her continued nasty comments. She kept telling me I needed to contact Amazon to file my complaint, and I was aghast that a company that sells beverages couldn't care less that they were selling a rotten beverage. She said 99% of the time they're not. So she is trying to make me feel better by saying only 1 out of 100 of their products is rotten? She told me she had nothing more to say and had given me all my options (having given me the Amazon.com phone number). At this point, I was annoyed, and maybe this wasn't the best thing to say, but I asked if she would be contacting the FDA about this. She told me that the FDA doesn't handle natural products. She said what would they do--tell us to use different coconuts? I finally said, I just want to know that you will pass this message along, and will you contact me to update me. Normally I wouldn't care. Normally if she hadn't talked to me like she had, I would have been happy for a refund or anything, none of which was offered. I don't need to know what the company will do. But she kept sarcastically saying she was going to pass my message along, and I told her based on her attitude I didn't believe she was going to do anything. She asked for my e-mail and said if I don't hear from them in 6-8 weeks, that she *really* hopes I call back.    I have worked in customer service, and I have had to put up with abuse from customers, so I never treat representatives like that. And I was nothing but polite to this person who was abusive to me.    If a rotten product wasn't enough to turn me off, the rotten attitude at the company's New York office was.
