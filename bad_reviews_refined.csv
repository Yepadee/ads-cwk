Vomited all of it up at 2:30 A.M.  Here is what happened.<br /><br />Prepared at about 9:30 PM, exactly according to instructions:  I brought 8 cups of Maine tap water to a rolling boil.  I whisked in the soup mix.  The empty package is sitting next to me as I type this.  The BEST BUY date on the package is January 14, 2017.  After the rolling boil I turned the heat down to medium and let the soup simmer for a good 10 minutes while occasionally stirring.<br /><br />Eating experience:  I took a long roll from the fridge and buttered it.  I dipped the roll in the soup and enjoyed this immensely.  I should mention though, that the taste of this Bear Creek mix was slightly suspicious from the outset.  It could have been much better.  I remember thinking that if it was homemade it would have had a much deeper broccoli/cheese flavor.  After I consumed the buttered roll, I poured the remaining soup in a cup with a dollop of creamery butter.  This was all consumed while watching a baseball game.  After the game I went to bed.<br /><br />I woke at 2:30 AM not feeling well.  Symptoms were slight nausea and the accompanying headache.  I drank some water and took two adult aspirins, thinking that this would allow me to settle down and return to sleep.  NOPE&#62;<br /><br />After about 15 minutes I began to realize that the nausea was getting worse.  I tried to get relief from burping.  NOPE.  Suddenly I realized that I was going to vomit.  As always when this happens to any of usâ€¦.this was a very violent, upsetting experience.  But afterwards I felt greatly relieved.  The nausea gradually returned, and the nausea headache did not go away after the vomiting.  I contemplated going to the emergency room.  It is now a little after 8 AM and the nausea and headache are gone but I am exhausted.<br /><br />When I pass by Bear Creek Country Kitchen soups in the store aisleâ€¦..you can bet that I am going to give them a wide berthâ€¦.VERY WIDE BERTHâ€¦.never again.<br /><br />Robert Lee Kingnever again.<br /><br />Robert Lee King",2015-06-21,-0.0434

You can just keep eating them with no work to get them out of the shell!  If you manage to put the bag down, you should refrigerate it.  Actually, you should refrigerate all nuts to keep them fresher longer as all nuts contain oils that go rancid and refrigeration will slow that process.  Note that these bags are only 6 ounces (1.5 cups), so the bags are smaller than you may expect.  However, since the nuts are shelled, there is no wasted space.

Discovered this gum a few years ago and this Sweet Mint flavor is our favorite. In fact, I got my sister and niece hooked as well.

Most other gums I've tried harden the longer you chew them, but this one NEVER, EVER does. Perfect sugarless gum, awesome flavor!!!!!	2015-01-21

I've been drinking chamomile  tea for a few weeks to aid intestinal discomfort.

I turned to Amazon as I frequently do and read about Buddhas Herbs with the highly favorable reviews and the detailed description of the product.

US	29100530	R12XS1RJ5566DG	B005HHE2WI	409478245	Alsosalt Substitute Salt, Original, 2.50-Ounce (Pack of 3)	Grocery	4	4	4	N	Y	So I needed something to fill the gap so all the food I eat doesn't taste like gruel. Let me say this	I can't eat real salt because of high blood pressure. After giving it up you realize just how much of your food has way more salt than any human should be consuming. So I needed something to fill the gap so all the food I eat doesn't taste like gruel.<br /><br />Let me say this. I love real salt. No substitute will ever come near it. But this product is probably the closest you can get to it. It does &#34;sort of&#34; taste like salt. When you taste it, you get the initial bite that you get with salt, but then the flavor never quite &#34;gets there&#34; and you have a subtle bitter aftertaste. Between this and nothing, I'd prefer this.<br /><br />Like other reviewers have said, AlsoSalt tastes pretty good in recipes that call for salt. You can even half and half it for a low-sodium variant of your favorite recipes. I've had this stuff on pork, chicken and beef and it works well. It's great in soups. I use it on scrambled eggs and hash browns. It's not bad over vegetables either. Anything that tastes bland that could have used salt I pretty much just coat in AlsoSalt, black pepper, and maybe some Tabasco sauce and it turns out pretty good.<br /><br />In closing: It's not as good as salt, but it's getting me through this. I'm already a couple weeks into dieting and I'm beginning an exercise regimen. Hopefully one day I'll get my numbers down and be able to eat the real thing again. But for now, this works.<br /><br />P.S. Never order this direct from the company. I placed an order for 2 bottles about 9 months ago and the company took my money, never sent the items, and never refunded me and don't seem to be answering my e-mails. Stick to Amazon.	2015-01-21

It can be found naturally in many plants, and commercial production focuses on extracting it from the fiber from corn cobs or wood pulp.  It can even be extracted from the fiber leftover when sugar is made from cane.<br /><br />There are several health benefits to xylitol compared to sugar.  It has significantly fewer calories than sugar and a significantly lower glycemic index, and the body does not use insulin to metabolize it, so it may benefit diabetics and those who are overweight.  It also inhibits rather than feeds the acid-producing bacteria that cause tooth decay, so it is often added to toothpaste, oral washes, and chewing gum.  The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry even supports recommending products with xylitol for use by children at moderate to high risk of dental caries.<br /><br />I compared plain Morning Pep Xylitol to ordinary granulated refined sugar.  The xylitol crystals are larger but are pure white, just like the sugar crystals.  It has a neutral odor rather than a sweet smell like sugar.  It seems to dissolve in liquids at about the same rate as sugar, perhaps a bit slower.<br /><br />The sweetness is very similar to that of sugar and it has absolutely no unpleasant aftertaste, but it is not quite as immediately intense on the tongue as sugar is and the flavor is not quite as complex.  However, when it is added to a beverage with flavor like coffee or tea, I can detect absolutely no difference.  Xylitol sweetens perfectly.<br /><br />When used in baking, more liquids may need to be used and it doesn't brown and caramelize like sugar does, but simply melts.  There are plenty of recipes available on the internet and it is fun to experiment.  Xylitol is generally used 1:1 instead of sugar.<br /><br />The Morning Pep Xylitol is of high quality, very pure and even in consistency and color.  It is made in the U.S.A. and comes packaged in heavy, resealable, moisture-proof pouches, which is very convenient.  I definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Morning Pep provided xylitol for evaluation and review.pure and even in consistency and color.

At 4-5 dollars a pop, it adds up quick. Taro was one of my favorites, and is great mixed with just milk and no tea.<br /><br />This product is identical to the taro drinks I've enjoyed. It's purple (lavender?), super sweet, and smells delicious. In fact at 4 lbs, I recommend that you purchase this with a friend, unless you are running a business. I found that even with my thorough enjoyment of taro, it was too difficult to consume all of the taro powder I had without getting sick of it.<br /><br />But this stuff is the real deal. I've had bad taro from restaurants, and I can honestly say that this is the best taro powder I've had. I recommend getting some coconut powder/mix to go with it- Taro and Coconut are some of my favorite flavors to mix when I go to a bubble tea shop. It looks like it costs a lot, but if you consider how much you'll save not buying from the store - it's a no brainer.	2014-11-29

The product is passable as an instant brown rice.  Not much flavor, but it's passable if you need a quick side-dish or some filler ingredients for things likes soups.  But nothing to write home about.    However, I would like to address the huge issue- this is DANGEROUS to cook in the microwave!  The box (and website) proclaims that the cooking time in a microwave is seven minutes for 2 servings.  The instructions tell you to put the water and rice into a microwave-safe bowl and set the timer.    I did this once a few months ago, and at the five-minute mark I took the rice out and noticed that the water had completely evaporated and the rice was bizarre and overly crispy in terms of texture, and had even started to burn around the edges.  I decided to mark it up to me maybe not putting in enough water, and simply made some on the stove.    I tried it for a second time yesterday while visiting a friend, and this time it ended up almost setting his microwave on fire!  Three minutes in, I peeked in and noticed that the water seemed to be completely gone.  Weary but wanting to follow the instructions, I decided to let it cook another minute before checking it again.  When I returned about 60 seconds later, I found the microwave FULL of thick, billowing smoke.  Panicked, I opened the door and looked to see what was happening.  The rice had began to turn a dark, dark, burnt brown color (even become smoldering and black in spots) and was starting to burn up!  I can only imagine what would have happened if I let it go the full seven minutes!    Neither microwave is dysfunctional, and both are fairly weak microwaves.  (Usually we need to put things in a little longer, if anything.)  I have never, ever had this happen before with a product.  (I've cooked other rices in microwaves before when in a bind, although I prefer stove-top, and this never happens.)  And the fact it happened with two different microwaves (including one nice, big and expensive one and a smaller generic one) is just insane.    This is ludicrous.

If I'd eaten any, even a drop, lethal food poisoning would have occurred. The University Medical Center Poison Control expert told me (when I called to ask if they were safe to eat) that botulism is the most dangerous toxin occurring naturally on earth. It is a deadly neurotoxin, causing possibly painful seizures, and then breathing stops as nerves die. The seller must have thought they'd save a buck by shipping a box of defective cans to an unsuspecting customer, and didn't care that whoever ate it would probably die! (I hope it wasn't intentionally malicious!) There is no more unethical, perhaps criminal conduct. Would it be manslaughter or murder, had I not known how dangerous it is to eat from dented or swollen cans? Even a very small amount, about a drop, can kill, the Poison Control Center said.

When you see a meat can spew out gas, a byproduct the bacteria produces that stays in the can is botulism neurotoxin. I was tempted to add it to my soup, but vaguely remembered a high school Home Economics teacher taught us not to use open or dented cans. They shipped me four or more swollen cans. The other six cans were not just slightly dented, but crushed on top with deep, sharp indentations, as though hit by a blunt instrument. So someone put 10 out of 12 highly dangerous cans of clams into one box and shipped them to me. I'm so lucky I thought to call Poison Control, or I'd be dead right now. Would you trust such a seller who'd do this, if you hadn't caught them? I'm writing this to warn others because the next unsuspecting buyer may not recognize the grave danger.",2013-11-22,-0.9983

I had to do a doubletake and immediately checked my order history.  It's true, they really weren't organic.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is yet another one of Amazon's listing errors.  I apparently did not notice this prior to ordering either; think my brain read 'ounce' as 'organic'. I was searching for around 35 minutes prior to ordering, so that no doubt had something to do with it.<br /><br />I figured what the hell; they were already delivered, I really wanted nuts, and because nuts are encased in shells (and thus protected from things like pesticides.. for the most part), I decided I'd eat them.<br /><br />Oh boy..<br /><br />They are stale.  Both packages, stale.<br /><br />The best by date says January 26th 2014. (mfg code 171260)  Either they were not kept in proper storing conditions at Amazon's warehouse, or the best by date is a farce.  Or, even worse, they are stored poorly at Bergin's facilities.<br /><br />Even worse is the fact that on average about 1 nut out of 3 either tastes rotten, musty or otherwise has a foul taste to it, causing me to immediately spit it out, sometimes being forced to rinse my mouth out as well.  This is the worst part about it, as I could deal with them being stale, but constantly being hit with a foul taste so often is not acceptable in any way.<br /><br />I guess this is part of the reason I buy organic.

That's important to note.  And, I stored them properly, per the instructions on the bag.  But after awhile (perhaps because they were around for a long time), my cats started to get sick after eating them.  Here's my story - and then you can decide whether you think you want to feed your cats these flakes or not:<br /><br />Although these flakes are for human consumption, the ingredient (100% Bonito Tuna Flakes) is identical to that in other tuna flakes I've purchased for my cats.  Given the huge cost savings buying these, I thought they were a great deal, and my two cats didn't seem to notice a difference.  They ate the flakes as their nightly treat for a month, then another, and into another ....  Eventually, my cats started to get sick nearly every night or near morning. At first, I thought one or both were going through a \\""hairball\\"" period and tried their hairball treats.  Nope, that didn't do the trick.  Then I considered their food and pulled back a new kibble I had added to their regular diet given they both had dental care done a few weeks back.  No change.  So, on to the vet we went to make sure the problem wasn't a side effect of their dental procedures (e.g., infection, some other problem).  Nope - my cats were otherwise healthy.<br /><br />But the problem persisted and was becoming a real issue: I was tired of seeing them miserable (in the times I saw them during the time they were sick) and I was tired of buying (and using!) SpotShot to clean carpet stains.  Finally, in desperation, I did the only other thing I could think of - I stopped giving them their tuna flakes.  They weren't happy.  They cried at night.  I live in a rural area and was patiently awaiting the next order of tuna flakes for cats (paid for 1-day shipping, but didn't order until late on a Saturday afternoon - alas!)  Here's the amazing thing: the nightly vomiting stopped. When the new flakes arrived (from a company I used before, who also sells flakes in volume, although about 1/3 the volume of this bag), I carefully started to give them their nightly treat again.  No problem at all.  They've been fine since.<br /><br />I'm not a scientist.  I can't conclusively state the flakes made my cats sick or at what point the flakes became too old to be safe for my cats.  These flakes are labelled as for human consumption, but the ingredient is the same as what is in cat tuna flakes (although I thought these flakes might be a touch \\""smokier\\"" in scent).  But what happened is enough for me.  I won't be buying these anymore.  Not worth it.  My kitties and I are back to a happy nightly feeding schedule with their old flakes and no problems!",2012-10-27,-0.9409

Sometimes things get dented in shipping, we all know mass-shipping is not always kind to products, and if they know it's not breakable like glassware, they are not careful. Anyway, I saw other reviews where people were afraid to eat dented cans, and I had to say something. This is misinformation. It is BULGING cans and/or cans with rusty looking seams that you are not supposed to eat. If it looks like the shipping container got wet, just clean the cans first, as you would do after a flood. I am a health inspector in California. Most people don't know that it is NOT even illegal to sell products past the out-date, at least in this state. Those dates are a guideline and we even license stores called Food Salvagers that sell primarily expired goods at a steep discount. Now I wouldn't necessarily eat expired dairy products, except yogurt with live cultures. And some bottled juices will separate after a very long time (way past the out-date), and the main problem with that is texture. Meat, maybe, depends on how it looks and if it's been frozen, but packaged goods are mostly good for a long time after that date. If it smells rancid or stale, then don't eat it. Oddly enough, saltine crackers are one item that gets really rancid eventually, and I'm talking a long time after the listed date. I get mad when I see grocery store personnel dumping wagon loads of food in dumpsters that are past the out-date when they could be donating them to people in need.

I followed the directions and washed with the soap and then made a lather with it, covered my posion ivy with the lather and let it dry on my skin.

The reason I am reviewing this particular item is because you CANNOT return it. I had never order food (if this really qualifies) from Amazon, and simply thought if I don't like I'll just send it back. Wrong!    My first impression was, what do I do with the liquid? The fettuccini comes in some type of brine or liquid preservative. After reading the package it says to pour the liquid out, rinse for 10-15 seconds, boil for 1 minute and then dry with a paper towel, after that simply add to your favorite dish. It is supposed to soak up the flavors in your dish.    Ok let's give it a shot. I cut a corner of the package and started pouring out the liquid. uhh, what is that awful smell...? The slimy liquid smells like fish. I had to open the faucet and wash the liquid as it hit the sink. I had to stop half way and wash my hands, the smell was very pungent.    I thought maybe this is an expire batch. So I looked for the expiration date and it read Nov 15, 2011. Ok, it is not rotten it is just the way it is. I got the strainer and just empty the rest of the packet in, liquid and all. I let the tap water hit it for about 30 second and took a swift, it still smell... so I man up and started washing the fettuccini by hand. It took about 2 minutes of running water and hand tossing to get all that liquid washed up.    I had a pot of boiling water going and put the fettuccini to cook for about a minute and a half, took it out and rinsed it in cold water (not in the instructions). Check for smell and it was gone. The true test was on the taste; well... it taste like nothing really, no flavor whatsoever. As far as texture it resembles pasta in looks; however, if I had to describe it I would say is like a jellyfish tentacle (not that I have ever eating one, but how I imagine it to be), somewhat chewy and a little slimy.     I did not have a prepared dish to add it to, so I added some parmesan cheese and ketchup and ate it like past. The verdict... it was a mediocre pasta imitation. Perhaps if I did not cook it myself but it was served to me, meaning I did not have to put up with the awful fish smell, I would have enjoyed it more. I just could not stop thinking, what am I eating?    The only reason I give it a 3 star is because aside from the fish smell at the beginning and that, what on earth is this? bouncing in my head the entire time, I think it could become an acquired taste. Also, if added to a soup or some heavy sauce dish, I can see a potential for this as filler.    At the end if you decide to try it, know that you may not be able to pass the fish smell and end up throwing the whole thing in the trash. I almost did. Also, remember that you may not return this product.    Bon AppÃ©tit",2011-09-20,-0.5995

Vita Coco has changed their formula to include vitamin C, possibly to prevent the problem I had: a product that smelled and tasted like rotting fish. About half of the products contained clear liquid, and about half when you opened them contained a urine-colored product, with the white cardboard around the mouthpiece having fringed into a brownish color. Vita Coco assured me this was a normal color variation. I drank quite a few of them, and the tasted varied greatly. Some were almost as sweet as glucose syrup and I had to cut them with water. Some tasted what I would call normal. And then I came across one of the brown mouthpieced ones with urine-colored product which smelled and tasted like rotten fish. I called Vita Coco again and again was told that I should be happy that there is a color and taste variation because it indicates a natural product. I was then interrupted and asked if I had a point I was trying to make. I told the customer service agent at Vita Coco I was telling her the product tasted like rotting fish. And she responded by telling me that she liked fish. She asked me if I call a lot of companies to complain about products. I will give myself a lot of credit and say that I remained calm in spite of her continued nasty comments. She kept telling me I needed to contact Amazon to file my complaint, and I was aghast that a company that sells beverages couldn't care less that they were selling a rotten beverage. She said 99% of the time they're not. So she is trying to make me feel better by saying only 1 out of 100 of their products is rotten? She told me she had nothing more to say and had given me all my options (having given me the Amazon.com phone number). At this point, I was annoyed, and maybe this wasn't the best thing to say, but I asked if she would be contacting the FDA about this. She told me that the FDA doesn't handle natural products. She said what would they do--tell us to use different coconuts? I finally said, I just want to know that you will pass this message along, and will you contact me to update me. Normally I wouldn't care. Normally if she hadn't talked to me like she had, I would have been happy for a refund or anything, none of which was offered. I don't need to know what the company will do. But she kept sarcastically saying she was going to pass my message along, and I told her based on her attitude I didn't believe she was going to do anything. She asked for my e-mail and said if I don't hear from them in 6-8 weeks, that she *really* hopes I call back.    I have worked in customer service, and I have had to put up with abuse from customers, so I never treat representatives like that. And I was nothing but polite to this person who was abusive to me.    If a rotten product wasn't enough to turn me off, the rotten attitude at the company's New York office was.

They only sell it in large quantities because after tasting one no one would ever buy a second one.",2007-12-31,-0.9361

So this bottle looked really cool at the drug store, never mind the name that sounds like tampons, but I was really unprepared for the taste. Flavored water is something I enjoy and like but this Blackberry Raspberry scented mess is the most disgusting tasting beverage ever! <br /> <br />The water is calorie free and has 11% of the daily serving of calcium and 4% of magnesium per 8 oz. I am used to heavily mineralized water and it's funky taste but this stuff is horrid. Splenda is used for sweetness, but with the flavors it tastes mildewy and nauseating, I don't care how good water is for me, this is something I will avoid form now on! I cannot imagine anyone buying tons of this from here, the taste is not acquired and sophisticated at all, that I can easily deal with but this is fake and plastic and the last thing this tastes of is fruit, blah... If I grow hair on my tongue this water will be the culprit! Lol <br /> <br />- Kasia S. <br />",2007-01-10,-0.527
