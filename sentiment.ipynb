       "17  I bought this from a local super market on a whim and decided to let people know how it tastes. I'm a huge fan of peanut butter and salted caramel.<br /><br />For instance, I had a Salted Caramel and Almond Kind Bar today and it was amazing. It tasted like you would expect it to taste.<br /><br />However, this particular product tastes like a chemical spill. It starts off with a peanut butter taste, but then the (caramel I'm guessing) tastes kind of burnt and chemical-like, and then it finishes with a very salty burnt taste.<br /><br />I had some on a spoon and disliked it, then I put some on pretzel bread and it was slightly palatable, but overall I would avoid this product as it doesn't really taste like salted caramel peanut butter.<br /><br />Just for fun, I let my co-workers taste it and only 1 out of 5 of them thought that this product tasted &#34;okay&#34;.

I wish 4c would just use regular sugar.  These fake sweeteners come at a price not yet fully revealed.  20 years of drinking aspartame or acesulfame could end up causing serious health problems down the road.  Not worth the zero calorie.  If it makes my heart race and flutter after a few drinks this proves that stuff has side effects.  Luckily for me it's instant.  What about those who show no signs now? Will they end up with cancer in 20 years?   \n",

My husband is allergic to peanuts but can eat all other nuts.  Previously the mix included only one bar with peanuts, which was great - I ate those and he could have everything else.<br /><br />In my last \\\\\"subscribe & save\\\\\" shipment, they sent a different mix of bars which has TWO kinds of bars with peanuts in them.  I am mad that they made this dangerous change without alerting us - previously there was one \\\\\"color\\\\\" of wrap that my husband knew to avoid.
