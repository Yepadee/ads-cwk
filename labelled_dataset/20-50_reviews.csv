The first batch we received it seemed fine and my son seemed to like it. No issues with gas or constipation. The next batch we received (subscribed with amazon) we immediately noticed something was wrong. When we mixed the bottles, it would foam up terribly. I ignored it since Gerber and similac did the same thing when we used those brands. Then my son started refusing to eat more than an ounce out of the bottle at each feeding. He was seven months old at the time so this is highly unusual. Again, I ignored this and assumed his appetite was decreased from teething. I kept telling myself &#34;this is the best for him since it's organic. No need to worry since he had no problems with it before.&#34;  Then my son starts belching and gulping in a sickly way. Kind of like an adult would if they have too much soda or if they have sour stomach...  Again I chalk it up to teething.

Vomited all of it up at 2:30 A.M.  Here is what happened.<br /><br />Prepared at about 9:30 PM, exactly according to instructions:  I brought 8 cups of Maine tap water to a rolling boil.  I whisked in the soup mix.  The empty package is sitting next to me as I type this.  The BEST BUY date on the package is January 14, 2017.  After the rolling boil I turned the heat down to medium and let the soup simmer for a good 10 minutes while occasionally stirring.<br /><br />Eating experience:  I took a long roll from the fridge and buttered it.  I dipped the roll in the soup and enjoyed this immensely.  I should mention though, that the taste of this Bear Creek mix was slightly suspicious from the outset.  It could have been much better.  I remember thinking that if it was homemade it would have had a much deeper broccoli/cheese flavor.  After I consumed the buttered roll, I poured the remaining soup in a cup with a dollop of creamery butter.  This was all consumed while watching a baseball game.  After the game I went to bed.<br /><br />I woke at 2:30 AM not feeling well.  Symptoms were slight nausea and the accompanying headache.  I drank some water and took two adult aspirins, thinking that this would allow me to settle down and return to sleep.

The nausea gradually returned, and the nausea headache did not go away after the vomiting.  I contemplated going to the emergency room.

You can just keep eating them with no work to get them out of the shell!  If you manage to put the bag down, you should refrigerate it.  Actually, you should refrigerate all nuts to keep them fresher longer as all nuts contain oils that go rancid and refrigeration will slow that process.
