I'm feeling sick to my stomach right now as I type this.<br /><br />I even dumped lots of salsa (really good fresh salsa) and mozzarella cheese over them in the hope this would get rid of the staleness, but despite microwaving thoroughly it didn't work.  Outside I shall dump this dish!  I probably could've tried baking them though- that usually works, but then again the box of shells I just had takes staleness to a whole new level.  My appetite's ruined for the day.<br /><br />Now if you eat these Mission shells the first couple weeks you buy them, no problem.  You can't store these ones for long periods of time like you can other brands.  That's the problem.  Be warned- they will turn your stomach the moment Mission shells go bad.  It's really surprising too.  I used to be someone who wouldn't complain at all about taco shells and just eat them anyway, but not this brand.",2015-08-12,-0.9722,1
