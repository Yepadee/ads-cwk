The reason I am reviewing this particular item is because you CANNOT return it. I had never order food (if this really qualifies) from Amazon, and simply thought if I don't like I'll just send it back. Wrong!    My first impression was, what do I do with the liquid? The fettuccini comes in some type of brine or liquid preservative. After reading the package it says to pour the liquid out, rinse for 10-15 seconds, boil for 1 minute and then dry with a paper towel, after that simply add to your favorite dish. It is supposed to soak up the flavors in your dish.    Ok let's give it a shot. I cut a corner of the package and started pouring out the liquid. uhh, what is that awful smell...? The slimy liquid smells like fish. I had to open the faucet and wash the liquid as it hit the sink. I had to stop half way and wash my hands, the smell was very pungent.    I thought maybe this is an expire batch. So I looked for the expiration date and it read Nov 15, 2011. Ok, it is not rotten it is just the way it is. I got the strainer and just empty the rest of the packet in, liquid and all. I let the tap water hit it for about 30 second and took a swift, it still smell... so I man up and started washing the fettuccini by hand. It took about 2 minutes of running water and hand tossing to get all that liquid washed up.    I had a pot of boiling water going and put the fettuccini to cook for about a minute and a half, took it out and rinsed it in cold water (not in the instructions). Check for smell and it was gone. The true test was on the taste; well... it taste like nothing really, no flavor whatsoever. As far as texture it resembles pasta in looks; however, if I had to describe it I would say is like a jellyfish tentacle (not that I have ever eating one, but how I imagine it to be), somewhat chewy and a little slimy.     I did not have a prepared dish to add it to, so I added some parmesan cheese and ketchup and ate it like past. The verdict... it was a mediocre pasta imitation. Perhaps if I did not cook it myself but it was served to me, meaning I did not have to put up with the awful fish smell, I would have enjoyed it more. I just could not stop thinking, what am I eating?    The only reason I give it a 3 star is because aside from the fish smell at the beginning and that, what on earth is this? bouncing in my head the entire time, I think it could become an acquired taste. Also, if added to a soup or some heavy sauce dish, I can see a potential for this as filler.    At the end if you decide to try it, know that you may not be able to pass the fish smell and end up throwing the whole thing in the trash. I almost did. Also, remember that you may not return this product.    Bon Appétit",2011-09-20,-0.5995,1

I was shocked at the horrible quality of the peanuts,  wether it be in the can, one gallon, or in the new tear bags that can be heated in the microwave oven.  The different kinds of packaging was fine, how ever the quality of the peanuts was just awful at best.  So many were just empty shells (approximately 30%) many had black like goo where the peanuts should be in the shells.  They appear to go from the ground directly into the boiling pot.  The taste is pure dirt water with grit in your mouth!  The shells are actually very ugly to look at before you start to open them.  They are very dirty, some look like normal peanuts, some were pure black in color, some have a good half with the other half nothing but soft mush.  Some looked like they had molded in the shell and then afterwards they were boiled and packaged ready to eat!  The peanuts I purchased had a really bad consistency in peanut quality. There is a lot of shell material in the cans, it makes one think that the company never changes out the water the use to boil in, hence the large amount of dirty shell particulate in the product.  Some of the shells were so rotten, I did not actually like touching the product with my fingers!  That is bad! Even trying to pick them apart was terminated because they were just too mushy and the inside merged with the shell to form a mass that definitely was not going into my mouth.

About half of the products contained clear liquid, and about half when you opened them contained a urine-colored product, with the white cardboard around the mouthpiece having fringed into a brownish color. Vita Coco assured me this was a normal color variation. I drank quite a few of them, and the tasted varied greatly. Some were almost as sweet as glucose syrup and I had to cut them with water. Some tasted what I would call normal. And then I came across one of the brown mouthpieced ones with urine-colored product which smelled and tasted like rotten fish. I called Vita Coco again and again was told that I should be happy that there is a color and taste variation because it indicates a natural product. I was then interrupted and asked if I had a point I was trying to make. I told the customer service agent at Vita Coco I was telling her the product tasted like rotting fish. And she responded by telling me that she liked fish. She asked me if I call a lot of companies to complain about products. I will give myself a lot of credit and say that I remained calm in spite of her continued nasty comments. She kept telling me I needed to contact Amazon to file my complaint, and I was aghast that a company that sells beverages couldn't care less that they were selling a rotten beverage. She said 99% of the time they're not. So she is trying to make me feel better by saying only 1 out of 100 of their products is rotten? She told me she had nothing more to say and had given me all my options (having given me the Amazon.com phone number). At this point, I was annoyed, and maybe this wasn't the best thing to say, but I asked if she would be contacting the FDA about this. She told me that the FDA doesn't handle natural products. She said what would they do--tell us to use different coconuts? I finally said, I just want to know that you will pass this message along, and will you contact me to update me. Normally I wouldn't care. Normally if she hadn't talked to me like she had, I would have been happy for a refund or anything, none of which was offered. I don't need to know what the company will do. But she kept sarcastically saying she was going to pass my message along, and I told her based on her attitude I didn't believe she was going to do anything. She asked for my e-mail and said if I don't hear from them in 6-8 weeks, that she *really* hopes I call back.    I have worked in customer service, and I have had to put up with abuse from customers, so I never treat representatives like that.

Perhaps it was something in the artificial strawberry flavoring (and others have commented equally strenuously) but in my opinion, these smell and taste highly toxic and - frankly - poisonous.

I received my order /months/ after my Amazon order (there was an interim point at which Amazon emailed me to see if I wanted to cancel the order). Amazon did not show out-of-stock at the time of order, so buyer beware.    2. As other raters have mentioned, the taste is moderate, although the longer you chew them, the more you can taste a subtle cherry flavor. The flavor isn't as strong as I expected, but I like variety, so this point alone wouldn't have stopped me from buying    3. These have pits! I find at least 1-2 in every bag. In addition, I find another several cherries with \\""crunchy bits\\"" which I suspect are remnants from pits that have chipped or broken during the de-pitting process. I've ended up eating these from the bag (very carefully), because they aren't safe enough to cook in muffins or breads (one of my original goals), because then you wouldn't be able to see when you are biting into one and the chance of dental damage would be even higher.    I have ordered other dried fruit from Bare Fruit, and enjoyed them very much (apples, mango, etc.) but I cannot recommend their cherries.

I cannot imagine anyone buying tons of this from here, the taste is not acquired and sophisticated at all, that I can easily deal with but this is fake and plastic and the last thing this tastes of is fruit, blah...
