I swirled the swampy bits around to see if maybe it would begin to resemble something food-like. Eventually, noodles and chunks of chicken made themselves apparent, along with wispy peppers and barely detectable bacon pieces. I hesitated. I allowed myself another moment of doubt, another moment during which I could have done the sensible thing and removed this unholy nightmare from my kitchen. But no. I put it in my mouth instead. It was...not good, but I kept at it with a weird sense of determination. It continued being not good, the only function of which it is capable.

That's important to note.  And, I stored them properly, per the instructions on the bag.  But after awhile (perhaps because they were around for a long time), my cats started to get sick after eating them.  Here's my story - and then you can decide whether you think you want to feed your cats these flakes or not:<br /><br />Although these flakes are for human consumption, the ingredient (100% Bonito Tuna Flakes) is identical to that in other tuna flakes I've purchased for my cats.  Given the huge cost savings buying these, I thought they were a great deal, and my two cats didn't seem to notice a difference.  They ate the flakes as their nightly treat for a month, then another, and into another ....  Eventually, my cats started to get sick nearly every night or near morning. At first, I thought one or both were going through a \\""hairball\\"" period and tried their hairball treats.  Nope, that didn't do the trick.  Then I considered their food and pulled back a new kibble I had added to their regular diet given they both had dental care done a few weeks back.  No change.  So, on to the vet we went to make sure the problem wasn't a side effect of their dental procedures (e.g., infection, some other problem).  Nope - my cats were otherwise healthy.<br /><br />But the problem persisted and was becoming a real issue: I was tired of seeing them miserable (in the times I saw them during the time they were sick) and I was tired of buying (and using!) SpotShot to clean carpet stains.  Finally, in desperation, I did the only other thing I could think of - I stopped giving them their tuna flakes.  They weren't happy.  They cried at night.  I live in a rural area and was patiently awaiting the next order of tuna flakes for cats (paid for 1-day shipping, but didn't order until late on a Saturday afternoon - alas!)  Here's the amazing thing: the nightly vomiting stopped. When the new flakes arrived (from a company I used before, who also sells flakes in volume, although about 1/3 the volume of this bag), I carefully started to give them their nightly treat again.  No problem at all.  They've been fine since.<br /><br />I'm not a scientist.  I can't conclusively state the flakes made my cats sick or at what point the flakes became too old to be safe for my cats.  These flakes are labelled as for human consumption, but the ingredient is the same as what is in cat tuna flakes (although I thought these flakes might be a touch \\""smokier\\"" in scent).  But what happened is enough for me.  I won't be buying these anymore.  Not worth it.

Sometimes things get dented in shipping, we all know mass-shipping is not always kind to products, and if they know it's not breakable like glassware, they are not careful. Anyway, I saw other reviews where people were afraid to eat dented cans, and I had to say something. This is misinformation. It is BULGING cans and/or cans with rusty looking seams that you are not supposed to eat. If it looks like the shipping container got wet, just clean the cans first, as you would do after a flood. I am a health inspector in California. Most people don't know that it is NOT even illegal to sell products past the out-date, at least in this state. Those dates are a guideline and we even license stores called Food Salvagers that sell primarily expired goods at a steep discount. Now I wouldn't necessarily eat expired dairy products, except yogurt with live cultures. And some bottled juices will separate after a very long time (way past the out-date), and the main problem with that is texture. Meat, maybe, depends on how it looks and if it's been frozen, but packaged goods are mostly good for a long time after that date. If it smells rancid or stale, then don't eat it. Oddly enough, saltine crackers are one item that gets really rancid eventually, and I'm talking a long time after the listed date. I get mad when I see grocery store personnel dumping wagon loads of food in dumpsters that are past the out-date when they could be donating them to people in need.
