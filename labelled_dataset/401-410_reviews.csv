The taste is great, but I developed significant abdominal cramps and bloating. I had to go to bed early because the pain was disabling and I had to use naproxen sodium for pain relief. I am still miserable almost 24 hours later.  I would not want this to happen to anyone else.

They all fall apart, into little pieces. too large, just gross stuff. Never again. You truly do, as they say, get what you pay for.

She quickly finished off a bowl of it this morning. I thought it a good idea to have some myself so I know what she's eating. The first bite tasted like some kind of chemically poisoning. After a few bites I got used to the taste and finished it off. Then twenty minutes later I began throwing up, out of the blue. This continued until I completely emptied my stomach of all the krave cereal. Now in doing some reading, I have learned this cereal contains GMOs. I'm terribly angry that as a consumer we are not told by clear labeling what goes into our food. We will NEVER buy this cereal again!!!!! I refuse to slowly poison my family. A strong stand needs to be made against GMOs!!!",2013-04-24,-0.9193,1
