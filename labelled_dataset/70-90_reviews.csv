I just bought a 4 pack of what should've been solid white albacore, what I opened was a disgusting pink slop that no matter how much you drain it, you end up draining pink ooze until there's not much left. Impossible to get the water out. It had thee most horrendous smell, far beyond the bit of fishiness I expect when opening a can of Tuna. That should've been my warning to throw it out!! But no, I was stupid and made the salad and we all got sick. Only those of us that ate it, my husband and son hate tuna so it's even more obvious it was the tuna. Everyone but the 2 that didn't eat it became ill. My mom got it the worst, but she's the oldest, so beware if you serve this to children or elderly. When in doubt, THROW IT OUT!
