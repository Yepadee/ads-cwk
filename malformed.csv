61,US,29100530,R12XS1RJ5566DG,B005HHE2WI,409478245,"Alsosalt Substitute Salt, Original, 2.50-Ounce (Pack of 3)",Grocery,4,4,4,N,Y,So I needed something to fill the gap so all the food I eat doesn't taste like gruel. Let me say this,"I can't eat real salt because of high blood pressure. After giving it up you realize just how much of your food has way more salt than any human should be consuming. So I needed something to fill the gap so all the food I eat doesn't taste like gruel.<br /><br />Let me say this. I love real salt. No substitute will ever come near it. But this product is probably the closest you can get to it. It does &#34;sort of&#34; taste like salt. When you taste it, you get the initial bite that you get with salt, but then the flavor never quite &#34;gets there&#34; and you have a subtle bitter aftertaste. Between this and nothing, I'd prefer this.<br /><br />Like other reviewers have said, AlsoSalt tastes pretty good in recipes that call for salt. You can even half and half it for a low-sodium variant of your favorite recipes. I've had this stuff on pork, chicken and beef and it works well. It's great in soups. I use it on scrambled eggs and hash browns. It's not bad over vegetables either. Anything that tastes bland that could have used salt I pretty much just coat in AlsoSalt, black pepper, and maybe some Tabasco sauce and it turns out pretty good.<br /><br />In closing: It's not as good as salt, but it's getting me through this. I'm already a couple weeks into dieting and I'm beginning an exercise regimen. Hopefully one day I'll get my numbers down and be able to eat the real thing again. But for now, this works.<br /><br />P.S. Never order this direct from the company. I placed an order for 2 bottles about 9 months ago and the company took my money, never sent the items, and never refunded me and don't seem to be answering my e-mails. Stick to Amazon.",2015-01-21

It can be found naturally in many plants, and commercial production focuses on extracting it from the fiber from corn cobs or wood pulp.  It can even be extracted from the fiber leftover when sugar is made from cane.<br /><br />There are several health benefits to xylitol compared to sugar.  It has significantly fewer calories than sugar and a significantly lower glycemic index, and the body does not use insulin to metabolize it, so it may benefit diabetics and those who are overweight.  It also inhibits rather than feeds the acid-producing bacteria that cause tooth decay, so it is often added to toothpaste, oral washes, and chewing gum.  The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry even supports recommending products with xylitol for use by children at moderate to high risk of dental caries.<br /><br />I compared plain Morning Pep Xylitol to ordinary granulated refined sugar.  The xylitol crystals are larger but are pure white, just like the sugar crystals.  It has a neutral odor rather than a sweet smell like sugar.  It seems to dissolve in liquids at about the same rate as sugar, perhaps a bit slower.<br /><br />The sweetness is very similar to that of sugar and it has absolutely no unpleasant aftertaste, but it is not quite as immediately intense on the tongue as sugar is and the flavor is not quite as complex.  However, when it is added to a beverage with flavor like coffee or tea, I can detect absolutely no difference.  Xylitol sweetens perfectly.<br /><br />When used in baking, more liquids may need to be used and it doesn't brown and caramelize like sugar does, but simply melts.  There are plenty of recipes available on the internet and it is fun to experiment.  Xylitol is generally used 1:1 instead of sugar.<br /><br />The Morning Pep Xylitol is of high quality, very pure and even in consistency and color.  It is made in the U.S.A. and comes packaged in heavy, resealable, moisture-proof pouches, which is very convenient.  I definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Morning Pep provided xylitol for evaluation and review.pure and even in consistency and color.

Not great, but not bad either.","This is a good coffee, but I was a little disappointed after trying it and having read other reviews. It is a little more bitter than I expected, and not as richly flavored as other similarly priced coffees. I admit there may be personal taste differences at play here though, so I am still giving it 4 stars, as it is by no means a bad coffee.<br />That said, I would probably buy a different kind next time.",2014-11-29

At 4-5 dollars a pop, it adds up quick. Taro was one of my favorites, and is great mixed with just milk and no tea.<br /><br />This product is identical to the taro drinks I've enjoyed. It's purple (lavender?), super sweet, and smells delicious. In fact at 4 lbs, I recommend that you purchase this with a friend, unless you are running a business. I found that even with my thorough enjoyment of taro, it was too difficult to consume all of the taro powder I had without getting sick of it.<br /><br />But this stuff is the real deal. I've had bad taro from restaurants, and I can honestly say that this is the best taro powder I've had. I recommend getting some coconut powder/mix to go with it- Taro and Coconut are some of my favorite flavors to mix when I go to a bubble tea shop. It looks like it costs a lot, but if you consider how much you'll save not buying from the store - it's a no brainer.",2014-11-29
