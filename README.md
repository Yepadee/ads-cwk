### Video Presentation 

Our presentation primarily consists of 4 parts: data wrangling, topic modelling, sentiment analysis and supervised learning. Instead of preparing one monolithic video covering all parts,  we have split up the presentation into into 2-3 min video chunks highlighting each part. We believe this will make it easier to understand, test, and verify our findings. The videos should be watched in order as the build on each other.

### Supervised Learning 
- **Summary**: To performed supervised learning, we needed to label the curently unlabelled dataset. Building on the findings from the data wrangling/sentiment analysis, we devised a way to efficiently label the dataset in a way that didn't require us to manually label all 2 million entries.  We then vectorized the data, performed additional optimizations,  and finally plugged the data into supervised learning models
